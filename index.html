            <p>My name is <em>Khairan Adediji</em>. I'm currently a student at <strong>Stutern</strong>, learning Front End Development. I started my journey into the tech space during the lockdown and had many stops and starts. But I've found I really enjoy the process and outcome of software development. So, I'm perservering; it is exciting to see that i can build a creer out of something I love and enjoy.

            <p>So far, I have learned to add structure to a webpage with HTML. I've also learned to use semantic HTML for writing cleaner, more meaningful code. I've learned and used CSS to apply styling to webpages, and how to manage my code with Git and Github. But most importantly, I'm learning how to be better at problem-solving and connecting other like-minded individuals.</p>

                <strong>Why is CSS important?</strong><br>
                CSS stands for <em>cascading Style Sheets</em>. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is critical when it comes to the overall presentation of a web page.

                <strong>What is the difference between padding, margin and border?</strong><br>
                Padding, margin and border are all a part of what is called the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">CSS box model</a>. The <strong>padding</strong> is the inner space between the content and the border of your box. The <strong>border</strong> is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line. The <strong>margin</strong> is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
            </p>

            <p>The main difference between padding and margin is that padding controls how much breathing room exists <em>within</em> a box, while margin controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists <em>outside</em> of a box. </p>
